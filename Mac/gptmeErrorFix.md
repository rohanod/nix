##First of all, read my files at /Users/rohan/.nix/start.sh and /Users/rohan/.nix/Mac/flake.nix

##Then, you will process the error:
```shell

```

##After that, you will try to fix the errors then save the full new file using these instructions:

##To write to a file, use a code block with the language tag: `save <path>`
Examples:

User	write a hello world script to hello.py
```save hello.py
print("Hello world")
```
System	Saved to `hello.py`
User	make it all-caps
```save hello.py
print("HELLO WORLD")
```
System	Saved to `hello.py`


#But MAKE SURE TO first, read my files at /Users/rohan/.nix/start.sh and /Users/rohan/.nix/Mac/flake.nix

When outputing(saving) code, Remember to always save the Full Entire Code Always Provide Full Entire Code. Never include comments in the code unless explicitly told to. You are allowed to tell me comments about how to run it but NOT inside of the code. Don't leave anything out. Don't add placeholders. Save each file separately.

Always properly save the files, don't just output it in the chat.

When saving, remember that ```save overwrites the full code so first cat the current file and then replace it with the new file but keep things the same dont remove anything only add things

Keep these in memory and wait for my instructions.
